# Geoffrey Gordon Ashbrook

I am a data scientist, fiddle player and flute maker from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. My passion for interdisciplinary and practical studies has lead me from biology, to K-12 science and language teaching, to Data Science. 

I am currently studing Data Science at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). I am interested in perhaps too many subjects, from best practice and organizational management, to education and human development, economics and finance, health and heathcare, consciousness, law, visual arts, poetry, botany, economic-botany, linguistics, international studies, mythology, history, traditional music, astronomy, cooking, woodworking, Philosophy of Science, literature, asteroid mining, folk dancing, astrobiology, etc. Practical applications of data aboud.

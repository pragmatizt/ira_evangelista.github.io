# Ira Evangelista

Before Data Science I honed my skills in sales, key account management, operations, and entrepreneurship. These developed my “soft” abilities on how to share persuasive stories, work in teams, and understand the drivers behind a company’s business decisions. I studied Data Science to marry two of my great loves: storytelling; and the ability to gain insights through data. 

I recently completed the Data Science program at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). 

My interests and hobbies include: economics, geopolitics, history, Dharmic & Eastern philosophies, hiking, scuba diving, health, fitness, and literature.
